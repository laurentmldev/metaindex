	Un schéma conceptuel (ou carte conceptuelle) est une représentation structurée d'un ensemble de concepts reliés sémantiquement. Les concepts sont liés par des lignes fléchées auxquelles sont accolés un mot ou deux décrivant leur relation : « mène à », « prévient que », « favorise », etc.

v2.0.2
# create new filters : left/right arrows are not blocked (going to next item)
#stopping and starting over seems to delete elk data! 
	pb in ELSrc docker config

#67 press escape to exit the "create new item" modal
#63 progress bar when creating new fields from CSV, and try to make it faster

#57 plus gros bouton pour entrer dans un catalogue
#58 increase DB size of field quotaFtpDiscSpaceBytes (int 64)

#56 hover texte sur l'étoile près de la barre de recherche
	rename ASC/DESC with CROISS/DECR in french
#65 add a "show more documents" button to increase amount of displayed results : implemented as autofeed when reaching bottom of the page

v2.0.1

#51 fill-in text for empty places
	create new element : if no field defined, add a message
	statistics panel : if no iframe defined, add a message
#50 dead-lock when creating a catalog after CSV upload of catalog delete?
#47 uploading test CSV with new fields (reference) : sometimes stopping at 2/3 items
#32 green earth : 
	- hover color is not visible
	- filter title not visible
#49 Catalog FTP port shall be definitive (stored in DB)
#48 fields are overlapping when too big
#38 Ref. fields multi yes/no is not functional (always yes even if flag is 'no')
#36 when switch in/out edit mode : shall stay in current tab
	#37 when creating a second new perpective, unable to create a new field, have to reload page
#46 FTP logging shall be possible even if user not logged-in MX app
#34 FTP server : delete uploaded file if quota just exceeded because of it
#33 quotas check when uploading csv : refused while lines could be just update of existing items 
#44 finalize welcome page

v2.0.0
#14 check user inputs : ensure no special nor space characters and are not empty
	- mapping names
	- perspectives names (and sections and types)
	- entry check for community name (lower case etc.)
	- links-graph form : nodes name
	
#7 presentation page
	- sign-up form
#31 define and prepare deployment tests for v2.0.0
FTP server port increments all when creating a new catalog
waiting message when creating a catalog
filter references in edit mode : stop propagation
#20 test usage statistics emails
#17 helps texts in french and english
#30 secure access to catalog's files
	Fix double'//' in URL prefix
	unable to access local files with main user session : seems to create a second user session, invalidating the first one when logging with the second one?		

#15 adapt GUI to access rights
	w to access rights (hide forbidden actions)	
	x visible color for selected filters
	x help icons 
	x hide for read-only users :
			create new items
			upload csv
			save filter
			modify filter
			
disable 'table' from perspective section rendering types (not implemented yet)

#25 when creating a new catalog, lexic panel still have contents of previously selected catalog

#24 once chosen manually, default perspective shall be persistent

#26 don't show catalogs for which user does not have access right at all

#27 'create new item' icon shall be star

Creation date is in UTC but interpreted as local time in Kibana GUI, 
so when creazting a new object, it is not yet visible using default time filter options ('now' is 2h to early)  
-> maybe play with advanced settings, setting timezone to UTC, or default search to now+2h ?

#16 removing a term present in several perspectives, it removes it from the second perspective while user have clicked on the first perspective ones

#8 prepare demo data, catalog/user present by default
	
#6 Kibana access control to indices
      x new catalog 
      		. create index
      		. create space
      		. create index-pattern
      		. create RO and WR roles
      		      		
      x user login
      		. create user in ElasticSearch
      x user change passwd
      		. sync passwd in ElasticSearch
      x user change role
      		. update roles list (update role for each accessible catalogs) in Kibana
      x user change index access-rights
      		. update roles list in Kibana
      x create term
      		. update index pattern
      x delete catalog
      		. delete roles and space and index-pattern
      		
x when catalogs list is empty, we create a new catalog, it is not visible in web GUI

#22 import data as CSV
	remove tmp files older than 10min
x lastModif timestamp not update : dates format error
- when logged-out, userProfileData.isLoggedIn still returns true, and user can still access to secured pages (but no web-sockets)
#12 backup/restore a full catalog / scrutation of "maintenance" flag in properties		 
favicon
when logging -> forward to catalogs instead of back to welcome
	fixed also "disable apache welcome page metaindex.fr:8080"
remove unused / unavailable datatypes (#15)
#10 : ? once logged out by time-out, log-in again leads to server error in the log :
		[ERROR] 2019-11-26 22:04:37.008 [clientInboundChannel-165] WsControllerUser - Unable to register 'laurentmlcontact-metaindex@yahoo.fr' on websockets API : toolbox.exceptions.DataProcessException: No logged user found for sessionId=17D057D02C30B14A409E42CC52EE048B.
		--> solved with #9 hopefully
		
#9 need to handle session time-out callback to kick-out user from catalogs registration when timed-out or logged-out
	- log-out user when autorefresh set enabled to false
	
#13 when creating a new element, list of "sort" dropdown gets append with duplicated contents

#4 phpmyadmin through SSL
#5 Kibana SSL proxy 
- ftp-server : properly close connection when quitting


#18 consolidate FTP server files management:
    - ftp  server restarted for each relog with new ftp server --> not reproduceable

#12 Reload details from DB : When modifying some data in DB, software shall get updated without having to shutdown it :
   . catalog details
   . user details (including new one)
   
#11 upgrade to dep spring MVC 5.2.0.RELEASE

- ftp-server check quotas
- ftp-server through SSL
- put code on git-hub
- implement quotas per user : max nb of elements and max disk size

- users count increase when same user logs-in several times --> 
- ftp ports to be opened in tomcat docker container

	Unable to process update_perspective from 'laurentmlcontact-metaindex@yahoo.fr' : Unable to perform SQLDb operation : Data truncation: Data too long for column 'perspective_json_string' at row 1 

- relationship between items
	- create network graphs

 - when creating a document while a 'join' field exist:
 	Item [1] : {"index":"lolo","type":"_doc","id":"WdJtEm4BlBSzXucQvAiX",
 		"cause":{"type":"exception","reason":"Elasticsearch exception [type=mapper_parsing_exception, reason=failed to parse]",
 		"caused_by":{"type":"exception","reason":"Elasticsearch exception [

- filters list auto-update when created or changed
- link to kibana misses the '#'
- edit image URL no possible
- when editing fields, pressing left key switch document 
- FTP access rights related to user access to catalog
- sort by Date / filter by date :
	// Kibana does not understand the timestamp field, if it's format is incorrect.Timestamp, 
	// which you selected by clicking on Time-field name when Configure an index pattern, need to be :		
		"timestamp":"2015-08-05 07:40:20.123"
		
		then you should update your index mapping like this:
		
		curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/applogs/1/_mapping' -d'
		{
		  "1": {
		    "timestamp": {
		      "enabled": true,
		      "type": "date",
		      "format": "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS",
		      "store": true
		    }
		  }
		}'
