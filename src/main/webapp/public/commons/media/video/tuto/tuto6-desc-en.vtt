6- Customize fields layout

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to control fields layout using perspectives
-
I will use the <b>demo_artists</b> catalog already imported in <b>Tutorial 2</b>.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000 line:50%
Explanations might go a bit fast sometimes, 
so feel free to pause the video, and breath!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:100%
First I log in MetaindeX app

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:100%
I've accessed this login page by clicking on <b>Sign-in</b> button,
top right of MetaindeX welcome page

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000 line:100%
Using <b>demo_artists</b> catalog created in Tutorial 2,
I click <b>Enter</b> button to access catalog's contents 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000 line:100%
and I click on Alfred Hitchcock to see contents

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:56.000 line:100%
default layout shows all fields over the whole area 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000 line:100%
I want to display only portrait, first name and family name

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000 line:100%
I'm not interested in other fields

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000 line:100%
I click on catalogs panel (top left) 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000 line:100%
and go to <b>Perspectives</b> tab

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000 line:100%
A perspective defines a list of fields to be displayed 
and how to display them

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000 line:100%
I start by creating a new perspective
with a click on main green button

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000 line:100%
and I give it a name. 
I want to use this perspective for film directors like Hitchock.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000 line:100%
a perspective is made of several <b>tabs</b> 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000 line:100%
I can add a new tab clicking on the "<b>+</b>" button on the right 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000 line:100%
each <b>tab</b> is made of several <b>sections</b>,
stacked one over each other

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000 line:100%
and each section contains a list of fields to display
I can add a new one using "<b>+</b>" button in the section

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000 line:100%
when adding a new field to display, I just pick one in the list

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000 line:100%
I've chosen field <b>portrait</b> here 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000 line:100%
I add a new <b>section</b> clicking on big green button at the bottom

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000 line:100%
and I call it <b>name</b>, it will contain full name of the artist

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:30.000 line:100%
and so I insert fields <b>first_name</b> and <b>family_name</b>

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000 line:100%
each section can be configured with alignment and frame visibility

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000 line:100%
I don't want first section to have a frame displayed,
just the contents

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000 line:100%
each field can also be configured with size, weight (bold,italic), 
color, and name visibility

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.000 line:100%
I just want the picture, and don't want to have text "portrait" behind it,
so I set field name to <b>Hidden</b>

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000 line:100%
same thing for the names, but I also want them
to be big and bold

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:23.000 line:100%
so I set corresponding parameters

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000 line:100%
okay I think my perspective is ready now,
so I go to catalog contents to see it in action

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000 line:100%
I click on <b>Enter</b> button and access catalog's contents

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000 line:100%
I click on Alfred Hitchcock, and 
I want now to apply my new perspective 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000 line:100%
I click on the gear icon, up to the contents

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.000 line:100%
that shows a popup with complementary actions :
- <b>Delete</b> : to delete current document
- <b>Perspectives</b> : switch to selected perspective 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000 line:100%
click on that last one will show list of existing perspectives
plus default one 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000 line:100%
so I click on my "filmdirector" perspective to activate it

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:13.000 line:100%
and I can see indeed that expected fields are displayed as expected

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000 line:100%
now I click on jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000 line:100%
I switch again from default to my new perspective

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000 line:100%
pressing "<b>p</b>" key as a shortcut
let met easily switch perspective also  

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000 line:100%
I can change then artists still using this perspective

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000 line:100%
now I want a specific perspective for guitarists,
and it shall be activated automatically when I open a "guitarist" artist

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000 line:100%
so I go back to <b>Perspectives</b> tab 
in catalogs panel

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:06.000 line:100%
and create a new perspective called "guitarist"

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000 line:100%
this perspective shall have just portrait on first tab
and guitars number on second tab

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000 line:100%
so first I add portrait

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:35.000 line:100%
hiding section frame and field name 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:06:08.000 line:100%
and then add a new tab and section to display <b>nb_guitars</b> field

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:100%
and I want this info to be rendered blue, bold and big!

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:50.000 line:100%
now I want to configure MetaindeX to use "guitarist" perspective when <b>type</b> is "guitarist"
and "filmdirector" perspective when <b>type</b> is "filmdirector".

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:05.000 line:100%
for that I go to <b>Overview</b> panel and set <b>"Detect perspective on field"</b> option 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000 line:100%
I set value to field <b>"type"</b>

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:23.000 line:100%
this way :
- when <b>type=filmdirector</b>, MetaindeX automatically applies perspective with same name ("filmdirector")
- when <b>type=guitarist</b>, MetaindeX apply perspective with name "guitarist"
- otherwise MetaindeX apply default perspective 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000 line:100%
let's go back to catalog contents and try this configuration

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000 line:100%
Hitchcock (filmdirector) gets indeed correct perspective applied

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000 line:100%
Marcel Pagnol (writer) gets default perspective applied as expected

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:53.000 line:100%
and Wes Montgomery (guitarist) gets also corresponding perspective applied

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:04.000 line:100%
well, that's it folks.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:14.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***
