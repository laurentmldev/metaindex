5- Configure fields enumerations

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to configure a field
enumeration, allowing then easier editing with dropdown list and checkboxes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:100%
so let's get started with a log-in into MetaindeX

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000 line:100%
we use the <b>demo_artists</b> catalog seen in previous tutorials

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000 line:100%
fields like <b>gender</b> typically could have a list of possible values : 
<b>woman</b>, <b>man</b>, <b>undefined</b>

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000 line:100%
then, when editing this field, we would have a clickable list
rather than free text input

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000 line:100%
that can be done in catalog's <b>Fields</b> configutation panel

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:100%
here are listed all fields used in the catalog

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000 line:100%
with the <b>Name</b> and <b>Type</b>

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:100%
but also 2 columns named <b>Enumeration</b> and <b>Multi</b>

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000 line:100%
<b>Enumeration</b> would contain the coma-separated list of acceptable values

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000 line:100%
<b>Multi</b> says if several values at the same time are allowed

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000 line:100%
so we'll define a set of allowed values for the field <b>gender</b>

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000 line:100%
<i>separated with ','</i>

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000 line:100%
let's try it ...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000 line:100%
so indeed, we can choose among expected values

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:30.000 line:100%
and now activating the <b>Multi</b> option ...

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:50.000 line:100%
yes we can select several values

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000 line:100%
well, that's it folks.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:25.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***
