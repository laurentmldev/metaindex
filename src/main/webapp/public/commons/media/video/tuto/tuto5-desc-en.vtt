5- Configure fields enumerations

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to configure field enumeration, 
allowing easier editing with dropdown list and checkboxes.
-
I will use the <b>demo_artists</b> catalog already imported in <b>Tutorial 2</b>.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500 line:50%
Explanations might go a bit fast sometimes, 
so feel free to pause the video, and breath!

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000 line:80%
First I log in MetaindeX app

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:80%
I've accessed this login page by clicking on <b>Sign-in</b> button,
top right of MetaindeX welcome page

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.500 line:80%
I click <b>Enter</b> button to access catalog's contents 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.000 line:80%
and click on jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000 line:100%
I want field <b>gender</b> to be either <b>woman</b>, <b>man</b>, <b>undefined</b>

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000 line:100%
if I click on <b>Edit Mode</b> and modify this value, 
I just get a free-text input for now 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000 line:100%
what I want is a <b>list of choices to click on</b>

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000 line:100%
to configure that, I click on catalog's panel (top left)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000 line:100%
and go to <b>Fields</b> tab

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:100%
here are listed all fields used in the catalog

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000 line:100%
with the <b>Name</b> and <b>Type</b>

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:100%
but also 2 columns named <b>Enumeration</b> and <b>Multi</b>

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000 line:100%
<b>Enumeration</b> contains a <b>coma-separated list</b> of accepted values

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000 line:100%
<b>Multi</b> says if several values at the same time are possible

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:38.000 line:100%
so I define a set of allowed values for the field <b>gender</b>
<i>separated with ','</i>

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000 line:100%
I enter now into catalogs contents pressing <b>Enter</b> button

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000 line:100%
I open jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery, whos <b>gender</b> is "man"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000 line:100%
I activate <b>Edit Mode</b> and click on <b>gender</b> field

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.000 line:100%
so indeed, now I can choose among a list of possible values

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000 line:100%
now I want to allow several values at the same time,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000 line:100%
I go back to <b>Catalogs panel</b>, <b>Fields</b> tab,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:22.000 line:100%
I activate the <b>Multi</b> option for field <b>gender</b>

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000 line:100%
I go back to Wes Montgomery in catalog's contents

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000 line:100%
I activate again <b>Edit Mode</b> and change <b>gender</> value

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:50.000 line:100%
I can now select several values at the same time

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:06.000 line:100%
now I go back to disable <b>Multi</b> option 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000 line:100%
well, that's it folks.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:25.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***
