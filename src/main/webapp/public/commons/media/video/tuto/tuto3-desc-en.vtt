3- Statistic charts with Kibana

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to use integrated Kibana module from ElasticStack
to create charts based on your catalog contents

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000 line:80%
Let's log into MetaindeX

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000 line:80%
we'll go with the 'demo_artists' catalog created in previous tutorial "Excel import/export"  

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000 line:80%
For the statistics, we'll focus on following fields:  

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000 line:80%
<b>birthdate</b> : used for ordering artists chronologically  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000 line:80%
<b>birthyear</b> : deduced from <b>birthdate</b>, it allows easier processing in Kibana in some cases

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000 line:80%
<b>nb_guitars</b> : a number saying how many guitars the character owns

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.500 line:80%
<b>type</b> : can be either <b>writer</b> <b>actor</b> <b>filmmaker</b> <b>guitarist<b>

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000 line:80%
<b>sex</b> : the gender, can be either <b>male</b> or <b>female<b>

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000 line:80%
So Linda Hamilton (aka Sarah Connor) is :
- <b>nb_guitars</b> : 4
- <b>type</b> : actor
- <b>sex</b> : female

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
now we go back to catalog's <b>overview</b> panel

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:20.000 line:80%
configure Kibana to sort the documents by <b>birthdate</b> 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:80%
(otherwise it's using the date of the last modification of the document) 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000 line:80%
now to enter the statistics module, we go left panel and click on "Go to Kibana" 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000 line:80%
that will open a new tab

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000 line:80%
Kibana is a complete independant app from ElasticStack, 
running over the same database than MetaindeX 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000 line:80%
so we'll need to log in again
but we can use same credentials than MetaindeX  
 
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000 line:100%
since Kibana runs over the same database than MetaindeX

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000 line:100%
we'll find there the same contents than in our catalog

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000 line:100%
Kibana interface is mainly made of 3 panels :
- Discover
- Dashboard
- Visualize

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000 line:100%
Discover panel just gives a basic trace of available documents, which is currently empty

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000 line:100%
because Kibana search window starts by default 15mins ago ...
while our <b>birthdates</b> starts several decades ago. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000 line:100%
so let's start from year 1700 to include birth dates of all our artists 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.000 line:100%
we can see then a simple distribution of documents along birth dates
(remember we've set <b>birthdate</b> as a Kibana chronology reference)  

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000 line:100%
we'll go now into Visualize panel to create our first chart

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000 line:100%
Kibana offers several types of charts,
we'll only show the use of 2 of them in this tutorial

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000 line:100%
starting with a classical Pie chart

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000 line:100%
confirm the catalog we use

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000 line:100%
Kibana charts are mainly configured with 2 steps:

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:17.000 line:100%
1- grouping documents into so called <b>buckets</b>
2- out of each bucket, compute a value to display, called a <b>metric</b>

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000 line:100%
(the simplest metric is the count of documents per bucket)

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000 line:100%
for the pie chart, each bucket is a slice of the pie 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000 line:100%
we'll group artists into separate buckets 
based on their <b><b>type<b></b>

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000 line:100%
<i>either "writer" "actor" "filmmaker" "guitarist"</i>

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000 line:100%
for performance,
we'll use <b>type.keyword</b> 
rather than just <b>type</b> 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000 line:100%
because field <b>type</b> has 
a predefined list of values

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000 line:100%
we can then update the chart 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000 line:100%
we see that 32% are writers

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000 line:100%
and 29% are actors

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.000 line:100%
several rendering options are available

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000 line:100%
let's save this chart

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000 line:100%
now we'll change the metric 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000 line:100%
instead of documents count
 
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000 line:100%
we'll show distribution of guitars among our 4 types

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000 line:100%
meaning that each slice represent the 
total amount of guitars owned by artists of this type

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000 line:100%
and we save it also 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:20.000 line:100%
we'll add now another chart

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.000 line:100%
displaying genders evolution through the years
as histogram

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:40.000 line:100%
let's start grouping artists by quarters of century
defining buckets for the X-axis

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000 line:100%
this can be done with <b>Histogram</b> aggregation

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000 line:100%
applied to the <b>birthyear</b> field

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000 line:100%
grouping documents every 25 years

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000 line:100%
so this first result is the artists count 
per periods of 25 years

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:15.000 line:100%
we will now split each 25-year bucket 
into sub-buckets discriminated by gender

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:100%
here is same procedure than for the pie slices 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000 line:100%
haaa interesting.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:40.000 line:100%
let's choose more meaningful colors,
say ... hum ... what about blue for boys and pink for ladies ?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.000 line:100%
well we can see that this corpus is definitely not gender-balanced ... sorry for that!

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:05.000 line:100%
I still want to save it, just for the demo

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000 line:100%
last thing, we'll put together our 3 visuals into a dashboard

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000 line:100%
just click to add them

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000 line:100%
we can then rearrange them at will

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:35.000 line:100%
and then save the dashboard

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:48.000 line:100%
please note that those charts are <b>dynamic</b>
and will be updated each time we change things in MetaindeX

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:01.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:01.000 line:30%
