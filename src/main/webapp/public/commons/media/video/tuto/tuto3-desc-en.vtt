00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000 line:50% 
3- Statistic charts with Kibana

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000 line:50%
We'll create charts based on your catalog contents.
This tutorial is quite dense, so feel free to 
pause the video and take time to understand each step.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000 line:50%
We'll learn here how to make a <b>pie chart</b> and a <b>chronological histogram</b>. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000 line:80%
First I need to log into MetaindeX.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000 line:80%
I enter into my <b>demo_artists</b> catalog 
<i>created in previous tutorial "Excel import/export"</i>  

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000 line:80%
For the <b>chronological histogram</b>, I want to see 
how men/women distribution evolves every 25 years, based on:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000 line:80%
<b>birthyear</b> : so that Kibana can group artists every 25 years 
<b>gender</b> : either <b>woman</b>, <b>man<b> or <b>undefined<b>

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000 line:80%
For the <b>pie chart</b> : 
<b>nb_guitars</b> : how many guitars the character owns
<b>type</b> : either <b>writer</b> <b>actor</b> <b>filmdirector</b> <b>guitarist<b>

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.000 line:80%
So Linda Hamilton (aka Sarah Connor) is :
- <b>gender</b> : woman
- <b>type</b> : actor
- <b>nb_guitars</b> : 4
- <b>birthyear</b> : 1964

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000 line:80%
In Kibana I want artists to be sorted chronologically based on their <b>birthdate</b>.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
I go into catalog's <b>overview</b> panel to configure that

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:20.000 line:80%
setting  <b>Kibana Timefield</b> to <b>birthdate</b> 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.000 line:80%
<i>otherwise sort documents using date of last modification</i> 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000 line:80%
I want now to enter statistics module

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000 line:80%
I go back into catalog contents

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000 line:80%
and then left panel // <b>statistics</b> //  <b>Go to Kibana</b> 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000 line:80%
that open a new tab in the browser

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000 line:80%
Kibana is a complete independant app from ElasticStack, 
running over the same database than MetaindeX 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000 line:80%
I log in with same username and password  
 
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000 line:100%
since Kibana runs over the same database than MetaindeX

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000 line:100%
I'll find there the same contents than in my catalog

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000 line:100%
access to main menu is on top left

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000 line:100%
Kibana interface is mainly made of 3 modules :
- <b>Discover</b> : contents overview
- <b>Dashboard</b> : view charts together 
- <b>Visualize</b> : create charts

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000 line:100%
<b>Discover</b> (documents overview) is currently empty

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000 line:100%
because Kibana search window starts 15mins ago ...
while our <b>birthdates</b> starts several decades ago. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000 line:100%
so I set <b>absolute start-date</b> to year 1700 
to include all my artists birthdates 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000 line:100%
I refresh with a click on <b>Refresh</b> button on top right

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000 line:100%
I can see then a simple distribution of artists along birthdates

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000 line:100%
<i>remember we've set <b>birthdate</b> as a Kibana chronology reference</i>  

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000 line:100%
and each line shows contents of an artist

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000 line:100%
I want to create a chart, so I go to <b>Visualize</b> module

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000 line:100%
I click that big blue button to start creation wizard

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000 line:100%
Kibana offers several types of charts

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000 line:100%
I want a Pie chart showing distribution of artists among their types

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000 line:100%
<i>I just confirm the catalog to use</i>

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000 line:100%
Kibana charts are mainly configured with 2 steps:

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000 line:100%
1- grouping documents into so called <b>buckets</b>

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000 line:100%
2- out of each bucket, compute an aggregated value to display, called a <b>metric</b>

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000 line:100%
<i>the simplest metric is the Count of documents per bucket</i>

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000 line:100%
I want to group artists by <b>type</b> 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000 line:100%
so I define buckets based on <b>type</b> field

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:100%
choosing the <b>Terms</b> aggregation

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000 line:100%
I don't want Kibana to split separate words

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000 line:100%
value <i>"brown fox"</i> shall gives a single slice of the pie,
not 2 slices <i>"brown"</i> and <i>"fox"</i>

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000 line:100%
for that I choose <b>type.keyword</b> instead of <b>type</b> 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000 line:100%
click on <b>Update</b> button on bottom right to refresh

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000 line:100%
I see that 32% of artists are writers

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000 line:100%
and 29% are actors

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:50.000 line:100%
I want a real pie rather than a donut, and visible stats
so I set up corresponding options

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000 line:100%
I click again on <b>Update</b> button to refresh

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000 line:100%
I like it and want to save this chart online
so I click on <b>Save</b> blue button up left

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000 line:100%
I give it a name 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000 line:100%
and confirm by clicking related button
 
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000 line:100%
now I want to see how many guitars each group owns 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000 line:100%
so I need to replace the <b>Count</b> metric
 
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000 line:100%
by the <b>Sum</b> of <b>nb_guitars</b>

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000 line:100%
meaning that each slice represent the 
total amount of guitars owned by artists of this group

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000 line:100%
click again button down right to refresh

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000 line:100%
I see that most of guitars are owned by actors (44%)

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000 line:100%
in other words, sum of <b>nb_guitars</b> field for <b>actors</b> 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000 line:100%
is 44% of the sum <b>nb_guitars</b> field for all artists

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000 line:100%
I save also this chart 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000 line:100%
activate <b>Save as new</b> option to create a new chart 
rather than overriding previous one 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000 line:100%
then I name it and confirm

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000 line:100%
to find my saved charts, I click on the <b>Visualize</b> link up left

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000 line:100%
now I want to create an histogram
showing genders evolution through the years 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000 line:100%
I click on <b>Vertical Bar</b> chart

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000 line:100%
I confirm on which catalog I want to work

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.000 line:100%
I group artists by quarters of century on X-axis

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000 line:100%
choosing the <b>Histogram</b> aggregation

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000 line:100%
applied to the <b>birthyear</b> field

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000 line:100%
grouping artists every 25 years

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000 line:100%
and click on Update button to see the result

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000 line:100%
I see for now artists count per periods of 25 years 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000 line:100%
<i>there are 21 artists for 1950-1975 bucket</b>

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000 line:100%
now I split each of those 25-year buckets 
into sub-buckets grouped by gender

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000 line:100%
using <b>Terms</b> aggregation (same than for the pie chart)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:100% 
but this time with <b>gender.keyword</b> field

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000 line:100% 
again I click Update to refresh

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:50.000 line:100%
I don't like those colors,
I'll use blue for boys, pink for ladies and green for undefined (quite creative no?)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000 line:100%
I see now that there are much more men than women in this corpus, 
although it's getting more balanced for the last 50 years

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:10.000 line:100%
I save this chart too

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000 line:100%
back to the <b>Visualize</b> panel

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000 line:100%
I want to see all those 3 charts together into a unique panel

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000 line:100%
from left menu I go to <b>Dashboard</b> panel

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000 line:100%
click on the button to create a new dashboard

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000 line:100%
and then on <b>add an existing object</b> link

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000 line:100%
I select my charts one by one to add them to the dashboard

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:55.000 line:100%
I customize the layout a bit

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000 line:100%
and then I save my dashboard

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000 line:100%
those charts are <b>updated automatically</b> 
each time something changes in MetaindeX

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:30.000 line:100%
back into MetaindeX
I'll for example remove all actors

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000 line:100%
in the search input on top of the screen 
I enter the query "<b>type:actor</b>"

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000 line:100%
I find 25 actors, and I delete them 
using contextual menu on top

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000 line:100%
be careful, there is no undo!

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000 line:100%
actors are now deleted

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000 line:100%
I clear my previous query
and get now all remaining 60 artists 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000 line:100%
I go back in Kibana

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000 line:100%
I refresh the dashboard and see all the charts updated!

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000 line:100%
well, that's it folks

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:18.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***
