*** MetaindeX Tutorials ***

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500 line:50% 
1- Basics and Overview

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, I'll simply create a catalog and add some documents in it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:50%
Explanations might be quite dense sometimes, 
so feel free to pause the video, and breath!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:80%
First I need to log in MetaindeX app

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:80%
user preferences are accessed via top right icon

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:80%
there I want to switch language to English and choose blue skin

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:80%
<i>because blue is nice</i>

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500 line:80%
I create now a new catalog to store my data

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500 line:80%
I go to <b>Create catalog</b> on left panel

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000 line:80%
I enter my catalog <b>identifier</b>
it shall be unique and simple (no space).

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000 line:80%
a statistic space is also created in Kibana
<i>see Tutorial 3 for statistics charts</i>

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000 line:80%
yellow box is just a quotas warning (I cannot create more catalogs)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000 line:80%
most important tabs are:
- <b>overview</b> : global parameters
- <b>fields</b> : list and customize data fields
- <b>lexic</b> : set appropriate names in English or French

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000 line:80%
I can click on <b>question marks</b> for contextual help

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
I start now defining catalog's lexic

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:80%
I set a full name and description

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000 line:80%
and give a custom name for documents, matching my specific funny data

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000 line:80%
I do same thing in French for my team mates from Paris

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000 line:80%
after a refresh (Ctrl+R) I can see the changes applied

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000 line:80%
and if I switch to French,
then French version of the lexic is used

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000 line:80%
I switch back to English language

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000 line:80%
I quit catalog configuration 
and enter now into catalog contents view 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000 line:80%
catalog is empty for now, 
and I'll create some documents

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000 line:80%
I go left and click on <b>Create New</b> link

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000 line:80%
no field neither is defined in this new catalog

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.500 line:80%
so I create 2 fields for my docs: 
<b>title</b> (type <b>string</b>)

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000 line:80% 
and <b>size</b> (type <b>integer</b>)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000 line:80%
It's important to choose proper datatype for statisics analysis
<i>see Tutorial 3 for creating charts</i>

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000 line:80%
then I fill in values and click green button to create a new document

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000 line:80%
each document is represented with a card
we can click on it to show contents

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:57.000 line:80%
I click to <b>edit mode</b> button and can then modify values

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000 line:80%
I create now few more documents

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000 line:80%
when the <b>locker</b> is closed, field value is kept for next document

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000 line:80%
field <b>size</b> keep its value for next document 
while <b>title</b> is cleared

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000 line:80%
I keep lockers open here since all data changes each time

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:80%
for each new document, a new card appears behind, in the contents panel

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000 line:80%
if I had already my data in a xls/ods/csv file,
I could use instead the import/export module

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000 line:80%
so that my data is automatically uploaded into the catalog
<i>see Tutorial 2 - Excel import/export</i>

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000 line:80%
so I can see here 5 cards for my 5 documents

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000 line:80%
but they all look the same

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000 line:80%
so I want set field <b>title</b> as cards caption
instead of generic text <i>Funny Thing</i>

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000 line:80%
I go into catalog's <b>overview</b> to customize my cards
clicking on <b>Catalogs Panel</b> top left

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000 line:80%
I use <b>Cards Title</b> setting

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000 line:80%
and select my field <b>title</b>

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000 line:80%
I go back into catalog contents 
to see changes applied 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000 line:80%
I can see that indeed <b>title</b> field is used for cards caption

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000 line:80%
I want now to explore my data with few search queries
<i>search input is on top of the main panel</i>

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000 line:80%
<b>size:3</b> returns documents whose field <b>size</b> equals <b>3</b>
<i>I click on the <b>magnifier</b> button to refresh</i>

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000 line:80%
this is <b>Lucene</b> query language, it is very powerful
to search and filter numbers but also strings and dates

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000 line:80%
I can also combine expressions with <b>AND/OR</b> connectors

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000 line:80%
<b>size:>10</b> returns documents whose field <b>size</b> is greater than 10

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000 line:80%
I can save my query in a filter, to reuse it later

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.500 line:80%
I click on the <b>star button</b> right to the query

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.000 line:80%
I give a name to my filter and confirm 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000 line:80%
then my filter appears on bottom left <b>Filters</b> 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000 line:80%
and I can click on it activate/desactivate the filter

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***
