1- Basics and Overview

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create a catalog and add some documents in it.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:50%
Explanations might go a bit fast sometimes, 
so feel free to pause the video, and breath!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:80%
First I need to log in MetaindeX app

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:80%
I've accessed this login page by clicking on <b>Sign-in</b> button,
top right of MetaindeX welcome page

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:80%
user preferences are accessed via top right icon

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:80%
there I want to switch language to English and choose blue skin

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:80%
<i>because blue is nice</i>

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500 line:80%
I create now a new catalog to store my data

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500 line:80%
I go to <b>Create catalog</b> on left panel

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000 line:80%
I enter my catalog <b>identifier</b>
it shall be unique and simple (no space).

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000 line:80%
a statistic space is also created in Kibana
<i>see Tutorial 3 for statistics charts</i>

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000 line:80%
yellow box is just a quotas warning 
<i>I cannot create more catalogs</i>

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000 line:80%
main tabs are:
- <b>Overview</b> : global parameters
- <b>Fields</b> : list catalog's fields
- <b>Lexic</b> : customize names in English and French

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000 line:80%
I can click on <b>question marks</b> for contextual help

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
I start now defining catalog's lexic

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:80%
I set a full name and description

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000 line:80%
and give a custom name for documents, matching my funny data

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000 line:80%
I do same thing in French for my teammates from Rennes and Dijon

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000 line:80%
after a refresh (Ctrl+R) I can see the changes applied

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000 line:80%
and if I switch to French,
then French version of the lexic is used

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000 line:80%
I switch back to English language

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000 line:80%
I access catalog contents 
by clicking on big <b>Enter</b> button  

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000 line:80%
catalog is empty for now, 
and I'll create some (funny) documents

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000 line:80%
I click on <b>Create New</b> in left menu

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000 line:80%
no field is defined yet in this new catalog

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.500 line:80%
I want 2 fields in my documents: 
<b>title</b> (type <b>string</b>)

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000 line:80% 
and <b>size</b> (type <b>integer</b>)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000 line:80%
It's important to choose proper datatypes, 
for later statistic analysis
<i>see Tutorial 3 for creating charts</i>

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000 line:80%
then I fill in values and click green button to create a new document

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000 line:80%
each document is represented with a card
we can click on it to show contents

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000 line:80%
I click to <b>edit mode</b> button and can then modify values

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000 line:80%
I create now few more documents

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000 line:80%
when the <b>locker</b> is closed, field value is reused for next document

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000 line:80%
so here field <b>title</b> is cleared 
but <b>size</b> is not

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000 line:80%
I'll keep both lockers open for next ones

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:80%
for each new document, a new card appears behind, in the contents panel

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.000 line:80%
If I have a xls/ods/csv file,
I can simply inject its contents with the import/export module
<i>see Tutorial 2 - Excel import/export</i>

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000 line:80%
so I can see here 5 cards for my 5 documents

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000 line:80%
but all cards look the same

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000 line:80%
so I want use <b>title</b> field as cards caption
instead of generic text <i>Funny Thing</i>

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000 line:80%
I go into catalog's <b>overview</b> to customize my cards
clicking on <b>Catalogs Panel</b> top left

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000 line:80%
I use <b>Cards Title</b> setting

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000 line:80%
and select my field <b>title</b>

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000 line:80%
I go back into catalog contents 
to see changes applied 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000 line:80%
I can see that indeed <b>title</b> field is used for cards caption

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000 line:80%
I want now to search for documents with <b>size = 3</b> or <b>size > 10</b>
<i>queries input is on top of the main panel</i>

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000 line:80%
<b>size:3</b> returns documents whose field <b>size</b> equals <b>3</b>
<i>I click on the <b>magnifier</b> button to refresh</i>

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000 line:80%
this is <b>Lucene</b> query language, it is very powerful
to search and filter numbers but also strings and dates

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000 line:80%
I can also combine expressions with <b>AND/OR</b> connectors

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000 line:80%
<b>size:>10</b> returns documents whose field <b>size</b> is greater than 10

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000 line:80%
I save my query in a filter, to reuse it later

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.500 line:80%
I click on the <b>star button</b> right to the query

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.000 line:80%
I give a name to my filter and confirm 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000 line:80%
then my filter appears on bottom left 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000 line:80%
and I click on it to activate/deactivate the filter

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000 line:40%
