[MetaindeX - Tuto 1]

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:50% 
*** 10 minutes basics and overview ***

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to inject data from Excel,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:50%
we'll customize main catalog's options,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:50%
and at last, we'll rapidly demonstrate the statistics functionality (based and Kibana tool).  

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:80%
Our input data is made of an Excel file (.ods format) 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000 line:80%
and a set of pictures corresponding to our entries.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000 line:80%
first column is a unique identifier

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000 line:80%
then various contents listed

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000 line:80%
*** be sure dates are of type 'text' ***

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000 line:80%
otherwise they won't be imported properly

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
'portrait' field contains the name of a picture 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
we'll upload corresponding files into the drive 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.000 line:80%
the last field is a reference to another entry  

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000 line:80%
this allows to define relationship between elements  

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000 line:80%
and study networks with tool 'Gephi' (see dedicated demo)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:45.000 line:80%
Let's login now to MetaindeX

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:15.000 line:80%
I'll set language to english and choose blue skin

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000 line:80%
Because blue is nice

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:30.000 line:80%
we create now a catalog to store our data 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.000 line:80%
Woops ... only very basic characters are allow here

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000 line:80%
This name is an ID. We can later choose a fancy human name to display

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:80%
The main panel allows to configure the catalog.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:80%
Each tab has a help explaining what and how

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:80%
We'll customize a bit our lexic

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.000 line:80%
We enter into the catalog now

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000 line:80%
We could create items by hand
but we'll better upload our Excel file for the demo

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000 line:80%
Just drag and drop the file

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000 line:80%
We select the fields to actually import

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.000 line:80%
Since catalog is brand new, we have to create new fields

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000 line:80%
Next time we import the file, that will be automatically matched

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.000 line:80%
Each entry is represented with a card

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000 line:80%
We can open one and see/edit contents

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000 line:80%
The picture is missing, because we haven't uploaded it yet

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000 line:80%
let's upload the picture files
they will be stored in a drive dedicated to our catalog

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000 line:80%
we can now refresh the page

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000 line:80%
and the picture is there, cool.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:35.000 line:80%
we can switch to edit mode and modif some contents

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000 line:80%
let's customize a bit the way cards are displayed

00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:10.000 line:80%
with custom cards title based on some fields we choose

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000 line:80%
and thumbnail image

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000 line:80%
et voilÃ  ! 
looks better no?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:50.000 line:80%
let's do some basic search queries

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:05.000 line:80%
we can save our search as a 'filter' and reuse it later

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000 line:80%
we'll now create a simple statistics chart
using integrated Kibana tool

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000 line:80%
first we need to tell Kibana to use 'birthdate' field for the time-line.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000 line:80%
Kibala is part of open-source ElasticStack suite.
MetaindeX uses it to get very powerful and scalable data management.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000 line:80%
just use same login/pwd

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000 line:80%
we'll show a very trivial example here,
but many things can be done with it

00:10:40.000 --> 00:11:10.000 line:80%
we refine the time period we're interested in

00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:10.000 line:80%
Kibana default time window starts 15min ago, that's no good for us, 
we want it to start before the oldest birthdate, to include all our artists.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000 line:80%
hum I feel like creating a Pie chart for the demo (i'm hungry)

00:11:40.000 --> 00:12:15.000 line:80%
we'll visualize repartition of artists by type

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:30.000 line:80%
this is a trivial example, see our dedicated tuto 
for more precisions on how to use Kibana
