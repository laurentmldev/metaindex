00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to create and customize a catalog

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000 line:50%
and how to create documents

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000 line:80%
Let's login now to MetaindeX

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000 line:80%
we'll set language to english and choose blue skin

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000 line:80%
Because blue is nice

00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:00.000 line:80%
we create now a catalog to store our data 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000 line:80%
only very basic characters are allow here,
this name is an ID. We can later choose a fancy human name to display

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
the main panel allows to configure the catalog.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000 line:80%
each tab has a help explaining what and how

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:50.000 line:80%
we'll customize a bit our lexic

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000 line:80%
after a refresh we can see the changes applied

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000 line:80%
we enter now into the catalog 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.000 line:80%
let's create manually few documents

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000 line:80%
with 2 fields : title (string) and size (integer)

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000 line:80%
the locker controls if the field shall be cleared after creating the document

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000 line:80%
we can modify values after creation of course

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:80%
let's create few more documents

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:55.000 line:80%
for easier overview, we'll customize cards title in the catalogs panel

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000 line:80%
using *title* field as a card caption 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000 line:80%
we can see our change applied here on the cards

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000 line:80%
now we'll end demonstrating basic queries

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000 line:80%
size:4 returns documents whose field *size* equals 4

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000 line:80%
size:>4 returns documents whose field *size* is greater 4

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000 line:80%
we can keep our query in a filter, to reuse it later

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000 line:50% 
The End
