1- Basics and Overview

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to create and customize a catalog

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:50%
and how to create documents by hand

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000 line:80%
Let's login first to MetaindeX

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:80%
we'll set language to english and choose blue skin

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:80%
because blue is nice

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000 line:80%
we create now a catalog to store our data 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000 line:80%
only very basic characters are allowed here, this name is an ID.
we'll show later how to set a fancy human name in the lexic

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000 line:80%
catalog panels allow to customize and control catalog's behaviour.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:80%
we'll customize here a bit our lexic

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:80%
let's give a better name and description to the catalog

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000 line:80%
we can also give a custom name for documents

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000 line:80%
you can define custom lexic in various languages if your team is international

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000 line:80%
after a refresh (Ctrl-R) we can see the changes applied

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000 line:80%
and also applies in other language

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000 line:80%
we enter now into the catalog 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:30.000 line:80%
catalog is empty, so let's create manually few documents

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000 line:80%
with 2 fields : title (string) and size (integer)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000 line:80%
we can modify values after creation of course

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000 line:80%
let's create few more documents

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000 line:80%
the locker controls if the field shall be cleared after creating the document

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.000 line:80%
for easier overview, we'll customize cards title in the catalogs panel

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000 line:80%
using *title* field as a card caption 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000 line:80%
we can see our change applied here on the cards

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000 line:80%
we'll end by demonstrating basic search queries

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000 line:80%
size:3 returns documents whose field *size* equals 3

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000 line:80%
this is 'Lucene' query language, it is very powerful
to search and filter numbers but also strings and dates

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000 line:80%
we can also combine expressions with AND/OR connectors

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000 line:80%
size:>10 returns documents whose field *size* is greater 10

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000 line:80%
more examples are given by clicking help icon left to the search input

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:50.000 line:80%
we can keep our query in a filter, to reuse it later

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.000 line:30%
