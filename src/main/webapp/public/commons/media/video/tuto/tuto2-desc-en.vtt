*** MetaindeX Tutorials ***

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500 line:50% 
2- Excel/Csv import and export

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:09.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll :
- upload into MetaindeX an .ods file and associated images,
- download from MetaindeX a .csv file for offline editing

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.500 line:50%
Explanations might go a bit fast sometimes, 
so feel free to pause the video, and breath!

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.000 line:80%
my .ods file describes some artists I like

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:100%
column <b>id</b> is a unique identifier 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000 line:100%
<i>MetaindeX will generate one for you if missing</i>

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000 line:100%
then some information about the artist (type and name)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:42.000 line:100%
then the <b>birthdate</b>
<b>ATTENTION</b> date columns shall be of <b>type 'text'</b>

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000 line:100%
otherwise exported value might be left blank in some cases

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000 line:100%
<b>birthyear</b> can be deduced from birthdate

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000 line:100%
it's easier for statistical studies 
to have it as a separate column

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000 line:100%
then comes artist's <b>gender</b>

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:100%
and a file name : a portrait of the artist, 
retrieved from Wikipedia

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000 line:100%
I'll use it to illustrate my artists in MetaindeX

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000 line:100%
then I reference Wikipedia as <b>portrait_source</b>

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000 line:100%
I imaging now that I would know how many guitars they own

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000 line:100%
and who is their favorite artist 
<i>using corresponding <b>id</b> field</i>

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000 line:100%
by chance they all like an artist already present in the list

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000 line:100%
ok now I log into MetaindeX

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000 line:80%
I've accessed this login page by clicking on <b>Sign-in</b> button,
top right of MetaindeX welcome page 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000 line:100%
I create a new catalog to store my artists data

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000 line:100%
<i>see <b>Tutorial 1</b> for basics on catalog creation</i>

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.200 line:100%
yellow box is just a quotas warning 
<i>I cannot create more catalogs</i>

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.000 line:100%
I enter into catalog contents

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000 line:100%
catalog is currently empty, and I want to upload my file,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:33.000 line:100%
so I drop it over catalog's contents area

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000 line:100%
I select the columns I want to import (left side)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000 line:100%
and assign corresponding catalog field (right side)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000 line:100%
my new catalog has no field existing yet,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000 line:100%
MetaindeX will create them during upload

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000 line:100%
next time mapping will be done automatically

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000 line:100%
choosing proper datatype is important for later statistical analysis
<i>see <b>Tutorial 3</b> create statistical charts</b>

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000 line:100%
<b>DATE</b> for dates
<i>remember it shall be text cells in xls/ods file</i>

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000 line:100%
<b>INTEGER</b> and <b>FLOAT</b> for numbers

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000 line:100%
<b>IMAGE_URL</b> for picture files,
which can be also a permalink URL pointing somewhere else on the web 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:100%
type <b>LINK</b> for connection to other documents
<i>value is the <b>id</b> of pointed document</b>

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000 line:100%
then I click green <b>Go</b> button to start upload

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.500 line:100%
MetaindeX start by creating new fields if any

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000 line:100%
and then upload contents of the file

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000 line:100%
so my data is into the catalog, 
each card represent an artist 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000 line:100%
but picture is apparently missing ...

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000 line:100%
this is normal because we haven't uploaded the picture files yet

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000 line:100%
so now I upload the pictures files 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000 line:100%
<b>Attention</b>: drop the files themselves, 
not the parent folder!

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:04.000 line:100%
then I simply drop those files over catalog contents

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000 line:100%
now I refresh the view (Ctrl+R) 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000 line:100%
and the picture is there!

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000 line:100%
but I want artists names as <b>cards titles</b> 
and portraits as <b>cards thumbnails</b>

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000 line:100% 
I go back into catalog's <b>Overview</b> panel (top left link)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.000 line:100%
I set <b>Cards Title</b> parameter 
with fields <b>first_name</b> and <b>family_name</b>

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000 line:100%
following  a '-' separator and then the artists <b>type</b>

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000 line:100%
and use <b>portrait</b> picture as thumbnail

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000 line:100%
I go back to catalog contents to see the changes

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000 line:100%
well it actually looks much better now

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000 line:100%
I work tomorrow in an obscure archives room,
and will need to work offline, on <b>women born before 1900</b>

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000 line:100%
so I want to extract corresponding artists as a CSV

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000 line:100%
first I search for them, writting query in the search input on top of the screen
<i>see <b>Tutorial 1</b> for basics on search queries</b>

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000 line:100%
<i>"women born before 1900"</i>:
<b>Query</b> : gender:woman AND birthdate:&lt;1900

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.000 line:100%
3 artists match this query: 
Georges Sand, Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000 line:100%
now I want to download a CSV with only those 3 artists

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000 line:100%
I click on left panel // <b>Import/Export Items</b> // <b>Download CSV</b>

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:50.000 line:100%
I choose only the fields we care about

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000 line:100%
and click on green button to start CSV generation

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000 line:100%
once file is ready, I click on the link download it

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000 line:100%
and edit its contents offline (here with OpenOffice) 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000 line:100%
I find in my archives that Georges Sand was actually a big fan of guitars

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:100%
so I modify contents of corresponding cell

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000 line:100%
and save the modification

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000 line:100%
once back home, to sync my data 
I simply drop the file again over catalog's contents

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000 line:100%
that time fields mapping was automatically recognized

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000 line:100%
and click on green button to start upload

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000 line:100%
I can see here that my value has been properly updated, cool.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:20.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***
