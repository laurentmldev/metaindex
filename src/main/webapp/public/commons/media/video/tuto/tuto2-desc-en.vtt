00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000 line:50% 
2- Excel/Csv import and export

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to upload an xls/odt/csv file into a catalog,
and associated data (pictures in this example)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000 line:50%
and then how to download data for working offline and then re-synchronize it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000 line:80%
first let's have a look to our demo file : a list of some artists and their description

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:100%
column <b>id</b> is a unique identifier. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000 line:100%
MetaindeX will generate one for you if missing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000 line:100%
then some contents precisely describing the artist

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:42.000 line:100%
<b>ATTENTION</b> date columns shall be of <b>type 'text'</b>

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000 line:100%
otherwise exported value might be left blank in some cases

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000 line:100%
birthyear is deduced from birthdate

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000 line:100%
it makes easier statistical study

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:15.000 line:100%
here are referenced some picture files we have  retrieved from Wikipedia

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000 line:100%
we'll use them to illustrate our artists with a portrait

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000 line:100%
we also know how many guitars they own

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000 line:100%
and who was their favorite artist (using corresponding <b>id</b> field)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000 line:100%
by chance they all like an artist already present in the list 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:55.000 line:100%
ok now let's log into MetaindeX 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000 line:100%
we create a new catalog to store our artists data

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:35.000 line:100%
to upload the file, just drag and drop it on catalog's contents area

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:45.000 line:100%
then select the columns to be imported and associated MetaindeX fields

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:55.000 line:100%
since the catalog is new, there isn't any field defined for now

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:05.000 line:100%
but next time we import similar file, the mapping will be done automatically

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000 line:100%
our data from .ods file is now uploaded into the catalog as we can see

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000 line:100%
but picture is missing

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000 line:100%
this is normal because we haven't uploaded the picture files yet

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000 line:100%
so let's upload the pictures into the catalog's drive 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:00.000 line:100%
same procedure, simply drag and drop the files 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000 line:100%
now we can refresh the view (Ctrl-R) 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000 line:100%
and the picture is there!

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000 line:100%
let's customize cards title and thumbnails 
in catalog's <b>Overview</b> panel

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:35.000 line:100%
cards title will be much more meaningful this way

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.000 line:100%
and we set artists portraits as thumbnail

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000 line:100%
well it actually looks much better now

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000 line:100%
we'll suppose now that we want to work offline on women born before 1900

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:25.000 line:100%
so we start by looking for them using a search query

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000 line:100%
we can now download CSV with this data, to work offline

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:50.000 line:100%
exporting only the fields we care about

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000 line:100%
we click on the link to retrieve the generated CSV file

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000 line:100%
and open it with OpenOffice

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000 line:100%
I suddenly remember that Georges Sand was a big fan of guitars

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:100%
so we modify it there in the proper cell.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000 line:100%
then we save the file

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000 line:100%
and then simply drop again the file 
over the catalog's contents

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000 line:100%
that time fields mapping is automatically recognized

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000 line:100%
since <b>id</b> field was defined in the file we dropped, 
corresponding entries in catalog are updated

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000 line:100%
we can see here that our value has been properly updated into the catalog contents


00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:20.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***
