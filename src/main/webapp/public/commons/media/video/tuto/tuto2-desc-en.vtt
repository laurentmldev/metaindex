00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000 line:50% 
2- Excel/Csv import and export

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to upload an xls/odt/csv file into a catalog,
and associated data (pictures in this example)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000 line:50%
and then how to download data for working offline and then re-synchronize it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000 line:80%
first let's have a look to our demo file : a list of some artists and their description

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000 line:100%
column *id* is a unique identifier. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000 line:100%
MetaindeX will generate one for you if missing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000 line:100%
then some contents precisely describing the artist

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000 line:100%
*** ATTENTION *** date columns shall be of type *text*

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000 line:100%
otherwise exported value might be left blank in some cases

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000 line:100%
here are referenced some picture files we have  retrieved from Wikipedia

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000 line:100%
we'll use them to illustrate our artists with a portrait

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000 line:100%
we also know how many guitars they own

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000 line:100%
and who was their favorite artist (using corresponding id)

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000 line:100%
by chance they all like an artist already present in the list 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000 line:100%
ok now let's log into MetaindeX 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000 line:100%
we create a new catalog to store our artists data

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000 line:100%
to upload the file, just drag and drop it on catalog's contents area

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000 line:100%
then select the columns to be imported and associated MetaindeX fields

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000 line:100%
since the catalog is new, there isn't any field defined for now

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000 line:100%
but next time we import similar file, the mapping will be done automatically

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000 line:100%
our data from .ods file is now uploaded into the catalog as we can see

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000 line:100%
but picture is missing

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000 line:100%
this is normal because we haven't uploaded the picture files yet

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000 line:100%
so let's upload the pictures into the catalog's drive 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000 line:100%
same procedure, simply drag and drop the files 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000 line:100%
now we can refresh the view (Ctrl-R) 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000 line:100%
and the picture is there!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000 line:100%
let's customize cards title and thumbnails 
in catalog's *Overview* panel

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000 line:100%
cards title will be much more meaningful

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000 line:100%
and artists portraits as thumbnail look quite nice

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000 line:100%
(for most of them...!)
 
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000 line:100%
we'll suppose now that we want to work offline on women born before 1900

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000 line:100%
so we start by looking for them using a search query

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000 line:100%
we can now request a CSV download of those artists

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.000 line:100%
exporting only the fields we care about

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000 line:100%
we click on the link to retrieve the generated CSV file

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:25.000 line:100%
and open it with OpenOffice

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000 line:100%
I remember now than Georges Sand was a big fan of guitars

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000 line:100%
we can then modify it there.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:50.000 line:100%
then we save the file and upload it into MetaindeX to update the catalog

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:00.000 line:100%
same procedure : just simple drag and drop

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000 line:100%
that time fields mapping is recognized automatically

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.000 line:100%
since *id* field is available, corresponding entries in catalog will be updated if found

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000 line:100%
we can see here that our value has been properly updated into the catalog contents


00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000 line:40%
