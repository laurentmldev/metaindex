4- Graphs and connections with Gephi

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll explore data connections, 
using the Open-Source tool <b>Gephi</b> to draw graphs.
-
I will use the <b>demo_artists</b> catalog already imported in <b>Tutorial 2</b>.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500 line:50%
Explanations might go a bit fast sometimes, 
so feel free to pause the video, and breath!

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000 line:100%
let's have a look to our original data file
<i>same file than <b>Tutorial 2</b></i>

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:100%
in column <b>favorite_artist_id</b>, values are ids of other artists

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000 line:100%
I want to draw graphs showing thoses links
and study relationships between artists

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000 line:100%
first I log in MetaindeX

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000 line:80%
I've accessed this login page by clicking on <b>Sign-in</b> button,
top right of MetaindeX welcome page

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000 line:80%
in <b>demo_artists</b> catalog, I go in <b>Fields</b> tab,
it shows fields used in catalog's documents.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000 line:100%
type of field <b>favorite_artist_id</b> is <b>LINK</b>

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000 line:100%
this way MetaindeX knows that value is another artist id

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000 line:100%
now I enter catalog contents pressing <b>Enter</b> button
and click on Marcel Pagnol

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000 line:100%
<b>favorite_artist_id</b> displayed value is a <b>name</b>,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000 line:100%
but going over with the mouse shows underlying <b>id</b> value

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000 line:100%
clicking on it jumps to Isaac Asimov, with corresponding <b>id</b>.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000 line:100%
search query contains now Asimov's id, so I clear it
to display again all artists of my catalog

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000 line:100%
so each artist points to its favorite artist

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.200 line:100%
now I want to generate a graph file, to open it with <b>Gephi</b> later.
I click on left panel // <b>Import/Export Items</b> // <b>Download GEXF</b> 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.900 line:100%
Each artist will be a <b>node</b> of the graph, and each link an <b>edge</b>.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.000 line:100%
I select which data to inject in the nodes

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000 line:100%
and choose also which links to use : <b>favorite_artist_id</b>

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000 line:100%
I click on <b>Start</b> button to generate the file

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000 line:100%
once file ready, I click on the link to download it

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000 line:100%
I go now in <b>Gephi</b>. This is a very powerful open-source
graphs tool, and it is easy to install.
<i>You'll find a link at bottom of this page.</i> 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:33.000 line:100%
I open the GEXF file I just downloaded

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000 line:100%
85 nodes are detected (the 85 artists)
and 85 edges (1 favorite artist each)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000 line:100%
I select <b>mixed</b> graph type to preserve edges direction
and press OK to load contents

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000 line:100%
<b>Gephi</b> offers 3 main modules,
visible on top of the screen

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000 line:100%
- <b>Overview</b> : control the graph

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000 line:100%
- <b>Data Laboratory</b> : explore and transform data 
<i>a bit like OpenRefine</i>

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000 line:100%
- <b>Preview</b> : customize rendering and export (pdf,svg,jpg)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000 line:100%
back to overview, <b>Graph</b> panel is a sketch of the nodes and edges

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000 line:100%
<b>Appearance</b> panel controls nodes and edges colors and size

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000 line:100%
<b>Layout</b> panel controls nodes position

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.500 line:100%
I can use the mouse to pan and zoom

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.000 line:100%
I want to colorize nodes by <b>type</b>

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000 line:100%
I select <b>colors</b> tool + <b>partition</b> mode  

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000 line:100%
and I select <b>type</b> field for partition

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000 line:100%
<b>Gephi</b> displays detected groups

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000 line:100%
I can now press <b>Apply</b> to see the result 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000 line:100%
I want now nodes size proportional to <b>nb_guitars</b>

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000 line:100%
I select <b>size</b> tool + <b>Ranking</b> mode 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000 line:100%
and choose <b>nb_guitars</b> field for partition
and click again on <b>apply</b>

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000 line:100%
bigger nodes are artists with more guitars

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000 line:100%
If I want size based on <b>number of connections</b>

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000 line:100%
I change <b>Ranking</b> to be based on <b>In-Degree</b>
(number of in-bound links)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000 line:100%
then bigger nodes are the ones 
seen more often in <b>favorite_artists_id</b> field

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000 line:100%
now I display nodes labels (artists name and type)
and refine labels size

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000 line:100%
I see now that flamenco guitarist <i>Paco de Lucia</i> is quite popular!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000 line:100%
I want to arrange nodes layout, 
because it's quite a mess for now

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000 line:100%
when loading a file, <b>Gephi</b> spread nodes randomly on preview area

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000 line:100%
several algorithms are available to improve nodes layout,
but there is <b>no absolute good solution</i>

00:04:42.000 --> 00:05:05.000 line:100%
I generally try various algorithms until I'm satisfied (enough) ...

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000 line:100%
and I can finalize with local improvements 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000 line:100%
Okay I think this is good enough, now I want a nice rendering to export it

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000 line:100%
so I switch to <b>Preview</b> module 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000 line:100%
there are several predefined profiles,
I like <i>black background</i>, aren't you?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000 line:100%
I click on <b>Refresh</b> to update the graph 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000 line:100%
and I need here to reset zoom level

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000 line:100%
it clearly needs to fix labels size

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000 line:100%
I uncheck <b>proportional labels</b> option,
to keep a constant labels size

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000 line:100%
and I cannot see edges,
so I set a bigger value in edges <b>Thickness</b> parameter

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000 line:100%
and <b>Refresh again</b>

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000 line:100%
Okay I like it now

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000 line:100%
I want to save it as SVG file ...

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:20.000 line:100%
on next step I'll want to study relationships 
between groups of artists (actor,guitarist,filmdirector,writer)

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:100%
I close current Gephi project and go <b>back into MetaindeX</b>

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000 line:100%
I click again on <b>GEXF download</b>

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000 line:100%
but using <b>Group mode</b> option

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000 line:100%
I want artists with same <b>type</b> to be grouped together

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000 line:100%
that will create one node per value of <b>type</b>
(actor,guitarist,filmdirector,writer)

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000 line:100%
and links will be aggregated to corresponding groups 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000 line:100%
still using field <b>favorite_artist_id</b> for the links

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:15.000 line:100%
I download the new file and import it in <b>Gephi</b>

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000 line:100%
the new file name contains 'groupby-type'  

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000 line:100%
only 4 nodes are detected this time, as expected
(actor,guitarist,filmdirector,writer)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000 line:100%
I select <b>mixed</b> graph to keep links orientation
and press <b>OK</b>

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:40.000 line:100%
I display nodes labels and increase their size

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000 line:100%
I colorize nodes in grey using <b>colors tool</b> + <b>Unique</b> mode

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000 line:100%
and I set nodes size proportional to <b>size</b> attribute
using  <b>size tool</b> + <b>Ranking</b> mode

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000 line:100%
this <b>size</b> attribute is the number of artists contained in each group

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000 line:100%
it has been added by MetaindeX during the graph generation 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000 line:100%
so I use it to draw bigger node if the group includes more artists

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000 line:100%
I increase a bit the maximum size to make it more visible

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000 line:100%
I see that there are more actors and writers 
than guitarists and filmdirectors 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:35.000 line:100%
I try to improve the layout

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000 line:100%
now I go to <b>Preview</b> to finalize rendering and prepare export

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:55.000 line:100%
I activate nodes labels and click on <b>Refresh</b>

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000 line:100%
but I disable label size proportional to node size

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000 line:100%
and I increase manually labels size

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000 line:100%
edges are in the direction of the <b>clockwise</b> curve

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000 line:100%
so I deduce the edge direction based on the curve

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:35.000 line:100%
I make edges a bit thicker 
using <b>Rescale weight</b> option and associated parameters

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000 line:100%
so I see from this graph that only few actors like writers

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000 line:100%
and not a single writer like an actor

00:09:50.000 --> 00:10:05.000 line:100%
and I save this graph too because I like it too

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:25.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:25.000 line:30%
