00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000 line:50% 
4- Explore connections within your data

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000 line:50%
In this tutorial, we'll see how to export GEXF (graph) files
to explore connections within your data with the Open-Source tool <b>Gephi</b>

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000 line:100%
let's have a look to our original data file

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000 line:100%
<i>the one we've imported into MetaindeX in tutorial 2</i>

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.000 line:100%
if you remember the field <b>favorite_artist_id</b> 
contains the id of another artist of our corpus

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000 line:100%
that's what we call a link and that's what
we gonna explore in this tutorial

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000 line:100%
now let's log in MetaindeX

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000 line:100%
we have imported this <b>favorite_artist_id</b> field
as a <b>LINK</b> type, rather than TINY_TEXT

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000 line:100%
so that MetaindeX knows that contents shall be 
a reference to another artist id

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000 line:100%
what we can see there is an artist name rather the original id

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000 line:100%
that's what MetaindeX shows us for conveniency

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000 line:100%
but underlying value is still the raw <b>id</b> itself

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000 line:100%
so each artist points to its favorite artist

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000 line:100%
now we'll generate a graph file (format GEXF)
clicking on the related button on left panel

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000 line:100%
we can select which data to export

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000 line:100%
and using <b>favorite_artist_id</b> field for the links

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:02.000 line:100%
in <b>Basic mode</b>, each artist is exported as a <b>node</b>,
and each link as a <b>edge</b> of the graph

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000 line:100%
we click to retrieve the GEXF file,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:32.000 line:100%
we open it with <b>Gephi</b> tool

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000 line:100%
85 nodes are detected (85 artists)
and 85 edges (1 favorite artist each)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000 line:100%
<b>Gephi</b> interface is made of 3 panels :

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000 line:100%
- <b>overview</b> : control the graph

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000 line:100%
- <b>data laboratory</b> : explore and transform data 
<i>a bit like OpenRefine</i>

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000 line:100%
- <b>preview</b> : customize graph display and export (pdf,svg,jpg)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.000 line:100%
back to overview, <b>Graph</b> panel is a view of the nodes and edges

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000 line:100%
<b>Appearance</b> panel to control the way nodes and edges are displayed

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000 line:100%
<b>Layout</b> panel to control the disposition of the nodes

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:40.000 line:100%
let's customize the nodes colors
based on corresponding <b>type</b>

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:56.000 line:100%
and size based on <b>nb_guitars</b>

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000 line:100%
maybe size based on number of in-going links is more relevant

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000 line:100%
this way the bigger the node
the more other artists like him

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:23.000 line:100%
adding nodes labels

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000 line:100%
so <i>Paco de Lucia</i> seems to be quite popular !

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000 line:100%
now we'll arrange nodes layout

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000 line:100%
which means <i>improving</i> nodes distribution in the view 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000 line:100%
there are several algorithms we can use for that
but no absolute <i>good solution</i>

00:04:42.000 --> 00:05:05.000 line:100%
so we generally play with various algorihtms
until we are satisfied (enough) ...

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000 line:100%
we can maybe do some local improvements if needed 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000 line:100%
we'll now switch to <b>preview</b> panel to finalize the graph
and export it

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000 line:100%
I like <i>black background</i>, aren't you?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:46.000 line:100%
we clearly need to fix labels size

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000 line:100%
and make edges thicker

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000 line:100%
let's save that graph as SVG file

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000 line:100%
we close this graph and go back to MetaindeX now

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000 line:100%
we'll now study connections between types

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:45.000 line:100%
using <b>Group mode</b> option : documents are grouped
depending on value of one of their field

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000 line:100%
<i>it's actually quite similar to Kibana buckets</i>

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000 line:100%
so we decide to group them by <b>type</b>

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000 line:100%
<i>"writer" "actor" "guitarist" "filmdirector"</i> 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000 line:100%
still using field <b>favorite_artist_id</b> for the links

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:15.000 line:100%
and we download the file and import it in <b>Gephi</b>

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:15.000 line:100%
<i>same procedure than before</i>

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000 line:100%
only 4 nodes detected this time as expected

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:50.000 line:100%
so let's improve a bit the layout

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000 line:100%
the <b>size</b> attribute is the number of artists contained by each node

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:05.000 line:100%
it has been added by MetaindeX during the graph generation 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:15.000 line:100%
so let's make bigger nodes containing more artists

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:35.000 line:100%
and try to improve a bit more the layout

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:50.000 line:100%
going to <b>preview</b> to finalize and prepare export

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000 line:100%
edges are in the direction of the clockwise curve

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000 line:100%
so we can deduce the edge direction based on the side the curve is

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:35.000 line:100%
making edges a bit thicker

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000 line:100%
so we see from this graph that quite few actors like writers

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000 line:100%
and no writer at all like an actor

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:05.000 line:100%
and we save this graph too

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:25.000 line:30% 
*** The End ***

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:25.000 line:30%
