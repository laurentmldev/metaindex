help.search.title=Search Queries
help.search.body=You can use very rich <i>Lucene</i> query language to search for documents.<br/>\
 Please see <a target='_blank' \
 href='https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax'>\
 <b>Lucene Query String Syntax</b></a> for complete documentation, but enjoy few examples here too :<br/>\
 <ul style='font-size:0.7rem'>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>quick brown +fox -news</i></b> :  documents containing &acute;quick&acute;,&acute;brown&acute;, mandatory &acute;fox&acute; \
  but not &acute;news&acute;</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>title:(quick OR brown)</i></b> : field &acute;title&acute; containing &acute;quick&acute; or &acute;brown&acute;</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>count:[1 TO 5]</i></b> : numerical field &acute;count&acute; >=1 and <=5</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>count:<5</i></b> : numerical field &acute;count&acute; < 5</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>date:[2012-01-01 TO 2012-12-31];</i></b> : date field &acute;date&acute; within given limits</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>qu?ck bro*</i></b> : use ? to replace a single character, and * to replace zero or more characters</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>-name:[* TO *]</i></b> : get documents with an empty or non-existing field &acute;name&acute;</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>NOT _exist_:name</i></b> : get documents without field &acute;name&acute; (which is more restrictive than previous example)</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>name:/joh?n(ath[oa]n)/</i></b> : regular expression patterns can be embedded in the query\
  string by wrapping them in forward-slashes (&acute;/&acute;)</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>quikc~ brwn~ foks~</i></b> : search for fields that are similar to, \
  but not exactly like our search fields, using the fuzzy operator ~</li>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>-_exists_:museum</i></b> : documents <b>not</b> having the field museum</li>\
 </ul>\
 Special MetaindeX fields :<br/>\
 <ul  style='font-size:0.7rem'>\
 <li><b style='font-family:courier' ><i>mx_updated_timestamp:[&quot;2020/10/15 23:00&quot; TO &quot;2020/10/16 12:00&quot;]</i></b> : get documents modified between the 2 given dates</li>\

You can save a given search as a filter (clicking on the star icon on the right), \
and then combine filters with each other by activating them together.<br/><br/>\
<b>Attention</b> : in current version, database does not know anything about translations which might be defined in \
catalog's lexic. The consequence is that <b>search queries shall use fields <i>basic names</i>, not translations</b>.

 

# Help Catalog Overview
help.catalog.overview.ftp.title=Port for accessing your files via FTP protocol 
help.catalog.overview.ftp.body=Each catalog has a dedicated drive where associated files can be stored.<br/><br/>\
This is typically useful to keep images or documents to be referenced from items of your catalog.<br/><br/>\
You can access this drive using a standard FTP client software \
like <a target='_blank' href='https://filezilla-project.org/'>FileZilla</a>, with following connection parameters :\
<ul><li><b>host name</b> : <i>metaindex.fr</i></li>\
<li><b>login/password</b> : your MetaindeX login and password</li> \
<li><b>port number</b> : this number</li> \
</ul>

help.catalog.overview.thumbnail_url.title=Catalog Thumbnail URL
help.catalog.overview.thumbnail_url.body=The path or URL of image to be used as catalog thumbnail.<br/><br/>\
It can be either a relative path to the catalog&acute;s drive (ex: <i>myfolder/myfile.jpg</i>) \
 or a plain web URL (ex: <i>http://www.some.server/cool_visual.jpg</i>).<br/><br/> \
If link does not work, please ensure there is <b>no slash at the beginning</b>, and <b>no double-slashes</b> at all, otherwise the \
built URL will be discarded by security filters.
help.catalog.overview.urls_prefix.title=URL Prefix
help.catalog.overview.urls_prefix.body=The prefix to be added in front of relative files path \
 (i.e. without &quot;http://&quot; prefix), in order to build a valid complete URL.<br/><br/>\
 Default value points to the catalog&acute;s drive (accessible via FTP), and this is \
 not advised to be changed unless you know exactly what you&acute;re doing.<br/><br/> \
If link does not work, please ensure there is <b>no slash at the end</b>, and <b>no double-slashes</b> at all, otherwise the \
built URLs will be discarded by security filters.
help.catalog.overview.cards_title.title=Cards Title
help.catalog.overview.cards_title.body=When exploring your catalog data, it makes your life easier if each item shows \
a short summary of its contents.<br/><br/>\
With this parameter, you choose which of the fields defined in the catalog shall be displayed as so.<br/><br/>\
This value shall be a coma-separated list of fields names : for example if the catalog defines &acute;name&acute; and &acute;age&acute; fields, \
then you can set this cards-titles parameter with the string &quot;name,age&quot; so that corresponding values are displayed as a summary.<br/>\
You can also add separators within quotes : name,&quot;-&quot;,age
help.catalog.overview.cards_thumbnail.title=Cards Thumbnail
help.catalog.overview.cards_thumbnail.body=The name of the image field to be used as item's thumbnail.<br/>\
Then a field with this name shall be defined for the catalog, and shall be of type <i>image</i>.
help.catalog.overview.detect_perspective_on_field.title=Automatic Perspectives Field
help.catalog.overview.detect_perspective_on_field.body=Perspectives define the way fields shall be displayed on the screen (see dedicated section for details). The name of the field to be used for perspective detection.<br/><br/>\
For example if two perspectives &acute;<i>person</i>&acute; and &acute;<i>cloth</i>&acute; are defined, \
and items have a field called &acute;type&acute; taking either value &acute;person&acute; or &acute;cloth&acute;, then corresponding perspective \
will automatically be activated when selecting those items.
help.catalog.overview.kibana_timefield.title=Kibana Default TimeField
help.catalog.overview.kibana_timefield.body=Which (date) field to use by default in Kibana


# Help Catalog Fields
help.catalog.fields.title=Fields Definition
help.catalog.fields.body=You define here all the fields your items can contain.<br/><br/>\
<b>Be careful</b> in current version, once created, a field cannot be deleted, renamed, nor its raw type be changed.<br/><br/> \
You can also define the list of all available values (coma-separated), allowing then to get a clickable list or, \
  in &quot;multi&quot; mode, cells to activate when editing document.
# Help Catalog Lexic
help.catalog.lexic.title=Catalog Lexic and Translations
help.catalog.lexic.body=You can define here translations for names and descriptions of your catalog and fields.<br/><br/>\
Those translations will be used in the MetaindeX interface, but underlying database is not aware of it though.<br/><br/> \
As a consequence, search and statistics queries will still have to use original basic name. 

# Help Catalog Perspectives
help.catalog.perspective.title=About Perspectives
help.catalog.perspective.body=Perspectives define items contents layouts, i.e. how to organize fields on the screen.<br/><br/>\
A perspective is made of 3 types of elements :\
<ul><li><b>Fields</b> : a field defined in current catalog, with layout options such as size and color.</li>\
<li><b>Sections</b> : A zone where fields are presented as a grid. Sections are stacked vertically one over each other.</li>\
<li><b>Tabs</b> : A panel containing a stack of sections</li></ul>

help.catalog.users.title=About Catalog Users

<li><b>Read-only</b> : can only see documents</li>\
<li><b>None</b> : can see nothing. This is the default level assigned to a user requiring access to the catalog.</li>\
</ul> 

# Help Items
help.items.data_upload.title=Upload Data File
help.items.data_upload.body=Upload a Data file (Excel,OpenOffice,CSV) into MetaindeX.<br/><br/>\
You can also simply drag and drop the file over the main panel.<br/><br/>\
This data file shall have its first row listing names of each column. They will be then mapped to a field of the catalog.<br/><br/>\
Special column name &quot;<b><i>id</i></b>&quot; can be used to define corresponding item ID in MetaindeX database. \
If such ID is already defined, then corresponding item will be updated with contents from the line, otherwise a new item will be created.<br/><br/>\
CSV format example :<br/>\
<span style='padding-left:3rem;font-size:0.9rem;font-family:courier;padding-top:1rem;' >id,firstname,lastname,birthdate,country</span><br/>\
