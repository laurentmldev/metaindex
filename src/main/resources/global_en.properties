  <b>Attention</b> : in current version, database does not know anything about translations which might be defined in \

  You can save a given search as a filter (clicking on the star icon on the right), and then combine filters with each other by activating them together.
 

# Help Catalog Overview
help.catalog.overview.ftp.title=Port for accessing your files via FTP protocol 
help.catalog.overview.ftp.body=Each catalog has a dedicated disk-space where associated files can be stored.<br/><br/>\
This is typically useful to keep images or documents to be referenced from items of your catalog.<br/><br/>\
You can access this storage space using a standard FTP client software \
like <a target='_blank' href='https://filezilla-project.org/'>FileZilla</a>, with following connection parameters :\
<ul><li>Your root metaindex server name as host (ex: <i>metaindex.fr</i>)</li>\
<li>the port number given here</li>\
<li>your MetaindeX login and password for authentication</li></ul><br/><br/>\
<b>Attention</b>For security reasons, your FTP access will be enabled only after having accessed at least once the catalog \
via MetaindeX web site.
help.catalog.overview.thumbnail_url.title=Catalog Thumbnail URL
help.catalog.overview.thumbnail_url.body=The path or URL of image to be used as catalog thumbnail.<br/><br/>\
It can be either a relative path to your catalog storage space (ex: <i>myfolder/myfile.jpg</i>) \
 or a plain web URL (ex: <i>http://www.some.server/cool_visual.jpg</i>).<br/><br/> \
If link does not work, please ensure there is <b>no slash at the beginning</b>, and <b>no double-slashes</b> at all, otherwise the \
built URL will be discarded by security filters.
help.catalog.overview.urls_prefix.title=URL Prefix
help.catalog.overview.urls_prefix.body=The prefix to be added in front of relative files path \
 (i.e. without &quot;http://&quot; prefix), in order to build a valid complete URL.<br/><br/>\
 Default value points to the your catalog dedicated storage space (accessible via FTP), and this is \
 not advised to be changed unless you know exactly what you&acute;re doing.<br/><br/> \
If link does not work, please ensure there is <b>no slash at the end</b>, and <b>no double-slashes</b> at all, otherwise the \
built URLs will be discarded by security filters.
help.catalog.overview.cards_title.title=Cards Title
help.catalog.overview.cards_title.body=When exploring your catalog data, it makes your life easier if each item shows \
a short summary of its contents.<br/><br/>\
With this parameter, you choose which of the fields defined in the catalog shall be displayed as so.<br/><br/>\
This value shall be a coma-separated list of fields names : for example if the catalog defines &acute;name&acute; and &acute;age&acute; fields, \
then you can set this cards-titles parameter with the string &quot;name,age&quot; so that corresponding values are displayed as a summary.<br/>\
You can also add separators within quotes : name,&quot;-&quot;,age
help.catalog.overview.cards_thumbnail.title=Cards Thumbnail
help.catalog.overview.cards_thumbnail.body=The name of the image field to be used as item's thumbnail.<br/>\
Then a field with this name shall be defined for the catalog, and shall be of type <i>image</i>.
help.catalog.overview.detect_perspective_on_field.title=Automatic Perspectives Field
help.catalog.overview.detect_perspective_on_field.body=Perspectives define the way fields shall be displayed on the screen (see dedicated section for details). The name of the field to be used for perspective detection.<br/><br/>\
For example if two perspectives &acute;<i>person</i>&acute; and &acute;<i>cloth</i>&acute; are defined, \
and items have a field called &acute;type&acute; taking either value &acute;person&acute; or &acute;cloth&acute;, then corresponding perspective \
will automatically be activated when selecting those items.
help.catalog.overview.kibana_timefield.title=Kibana Default TimeField
help.catalog.overview.kibana_timefield.body=Which (date) field to use by default in Kibana


# Help Catalog Fields
help.catalog.fields.title=Fields Definition
help.catalog.fields.body=You define here all the fields your items can contain.<br/><br/>\
<b>Be careful</b> in current version, once created, a field cannot be deleted, renamed, nor its raw type be changed.<br/><br/> \
You can also define the list of all available values (coma-separated), allowing then to get a clickable list or, \
  in &quot;multi&quot; mode, cells to activate when editing document.
# Help Catalog Lexic
help.catalog.lexic.title=Catalog Lexic and Translations
help.catalog.lexic.body=You can define here translations for names and descriptions of your catalog and fields.<br/><br/>\
Those translations will be used in the MetaindeX interface, but underlying database is not aware of it though.<br/><br/> \
As a consequence, search and statistics queries will still have to use original basic name. 

# Help Catalog Perspectives
help.catalog.perspective.title=About Perspectives
help.catalog.perspective.body=Perspectives define items contents layouts, i.e. how to organize fields on the screen.<br/><br/>\
A perspective is made of 3 types of elements :\
<ul><li><b>Fields</b> : a field defined in current catalog, with layout options such as size and color.</li>\
<li><b>Sections</b> : A zone where fields are presented as a grid. Sections are stacked vertically one over each other.</li>\
<li><b>Tabs</b> : A panel containing a stack of sections</li></ul>

help.catalog.users.title=About Catalog Users
help.catalog.users.body=Manage who can access to this catalog, and with which rights :<br/>\
